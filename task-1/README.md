# Task 1

### Purpose of the task
The task was to implement a function that checks whether the triangles collide.

### Running
The 'triangle' folder (our root directory) contains the program files that we need to run with cmake. You can create a build in the root directory to keep there build files.

```sh
cd triangle
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./rectangle
```

### Document with test
There is also pdf file (triangle-tests.pdf) with some tests done in main.cpp.
