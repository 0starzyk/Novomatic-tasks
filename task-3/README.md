# Task 2

### Purpose of the task
The task was to implement a generic function that deletes whitespaces around specified container (e.g. std::string, std::vector, std::list).

### Running
The 'whitespace' folder (our root directory) contains the program files that we need to run with cmake. You can create a build in the root directory to keep there build files.

```sh
cd whitespace
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./whitespace
```
